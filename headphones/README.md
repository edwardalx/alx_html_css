Importing a .fig File and Custom Fonts into Figma
This guide documents how to successfully load a Figma design file (.fig) with custom fonts.

✅ 1. Install Required Fonts
If the Figma file uses custom fonts (e.g., Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT), install them on your computer first:

Windows:
Extract the .zip font file.

Right-click each .ttf or .otf file > Install.

macOS:
Extract the .zip.

Double-click each font file > Install Font.

⚠️ Note on Font Detection in Browser
If using Figma Web, you must clear your browser cache before Figma will detect the newly installed fonts.

🔄 2. Install Figma Font Helper (Web Users Only)
If you're using Figma in a browser and want to use local fonts:

Download and install the Figma Font Helper:
https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956594

Then restart your browser or Figma tab.

📂 3. Import the .fig File
Option A: Figma Web App
Go to https://figma.com

Click the Figma menu (top-left) > File > Import.

Select your .fig file. It will open in Drafts.

Option B: Figma Desktop App
Open the app.

Drag and drop the .fig file into the window
or go to File > Import.

🧹 4. Clean Up and Use
The design will now load with correct fonts.

Float values in spacing/sizing (e.g. 52.6px) can be rounded for implementation (e.g. 53px).
